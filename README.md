3D Puzzle Platformer Prototype created in Unreal Engine during the seven day 2021 Epic Mega Jam. 

Most base classes were created using C++ and further extended with Blueprint visual scripting. 
Three unique orbs manipulate corresponding platforms by making them appear, disappear, or move, depending on which orb the player is holding. 
Custom components set the logic for individual puzzle platforms; an interface class  enables the player to pick up or place orbs at designated points. 
Should the player fall out of world, a checkpoint system returns them to the last place they picked up or placed down an orb.
Platforms and orbs were modeled in Houdini, allowing for procedural generation, then textured with Quixel Mixer. 
The prototype serves as the foundation for a passion project currently in pre-production with colleagues.

The repository has been made public as is. There will be no further updates.
